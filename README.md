#socket_demo

In the project, I creates 2 programs to demonstrate TCP/IP with socket library:
- ServerApp_CC++ - Server Program:
	+ It is programmed with C/C++ programming. 
	+ I create a socket class as wrapper function to use socket library. 
	+ The server can accept many requests from clients and each request is processed on one thread. 
- ClientApp_Python - Client Program:
	+ I write some scripts with Python programming to create clients which can connect to the server.
